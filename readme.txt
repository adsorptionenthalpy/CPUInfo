CPUInfo 1.0.0
Copyright (c) 2005 Chad Austin


CPUInfo is an open source processor querying tool for IA32
architectures.  Using the CPUID and RDTSC instructions, it queries
information such as the processor name, vendor, clock speed, feature
bits, supported instruction set extensions, and cache sizes from all
of the processors on the system.

It runs on Microsoft Windows (should work as far back as Win95 and
NT4) and any version of Linux that has process affinity support.  And
of course it requires an IA32 processor.  ;)  See Main.cpp for example
usage.

CPUInfo is available for use under the terms of the MIT license.  See
COPYRIGHT.txt for details.
